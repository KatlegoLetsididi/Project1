# Project1
Alpha dreamers Banking consortium is a financial institution that provides business loans, savings accounts, and checking accounts for individuals and businesses. In their annual review, the board of directors for the institution saw it fit to enhance its internal operations to stay ahead of the competition. A new wing of business intelligence has been initiated to assist the loans department to automate, predict and formalize the business processes. The loans department has realized that there is a high defaulter rate for personal loans and measures must be put in place to minimize the defaulter rates.
